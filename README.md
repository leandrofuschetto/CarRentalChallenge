## How to excecute

The app was developed in **Visual Studio 2022**, so only this IDE is enough to make it run.

For Database, in the first start of the application, the DB is created and some initial records are inserted. Will run in **SQLEXPRESS**.

In addition, it was configured in such a way that a Swagger UI is raised when the program runs.
